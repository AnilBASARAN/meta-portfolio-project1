                <img src="photo2.png" class="small-photos">
                <p>Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in edgy,
                     custom coloring techniques. 
                     She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients.
                      Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser, Garry. 
                      They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three colorists, one manicurist and one make-up artist.</p>
